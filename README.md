There is currently no content or visible conflict markers in `/c:/Users/dev.pandey/my-react-app/README.md`. If you are resolving a merge conflict, look for sections like:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes here
=======
Incoming changes here
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

To resolve:
1. Decide which content to keep (or combine both).
2. Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
3. Save the file.

Example resolved content:

```markdown
# My React App

Welcome to your project!
```

If you paste the conflicted content here, I can help rewrite it.
